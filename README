This represents my winter-to-spring 2010 attempt to autoschedule classes for Learning Unlimited programs.

The Haskell code is primarily used to read the XML, generate an integer linear program in CPLEX format,
and bind to the GLPK linear programming library.  I wrote a simple simulated annealer in Java in the hopes
of minimizing walking distance between rooms, but this really wasn't necessary in retrospect.
